<b>Blossomer</b> is a probabilistic melody maker by <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~dds2135/" target="_blank">David Su</a>. It takes as input a single voice of melody (represented by notes with pitch and rhythm attributes), performs single-order Markov chain analysis to calculate probabilities, then outputs an infinitely recurring melody generated using a simple sine wave.<br><br>

Despite the program's primitivity you can still hear it churn out something "new" while retaining the original "flavor" of a melody. Additionally, the different methods of playback generation yield noticeably different results. Check out the to-do list below for plans on making Blossomer more powerful!<br><br>

Piano keys adapted from Peter Coles' <a href="http://mrcoles.com/piano/" target="_blank">JavaScript Piano</a>. BPM tap button adapted from Rich Reel's <a href="http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm" target="_blank">Tap for BPM</a>. MIDI to Hz formula taken from <a href="http://subsynth.sourceforge.net/midinote2freq.html" target="_blank">Subsynth</a>.

<br><br><br>
<u>Future features (to-do list):</u><br>
- More advanced methods of analysis, especially the ability to take into account higher levels of structure (e.g. groups of notes as phrases, 8-bar structures, overall musical form) as well as melodic variation and embellishment<br>
- On that note, a better sense of rhythmic cognizance<br>
- Capability to "mix" different melodies by combining their probability tables<br>
- Addition of "noise"/chaos to control how far away to stray from the original melody<br>
- Alternate methods of melodic generation such as those based purely on intervallic relationships or talea + color extraction<br>
- A more robust audio interface (beyond a simple sine wave)<br>
- Ability to easily re-blossom the probabilistically generated melodies<br>
- Control of output size, rather than an infinitely recurring melody<br><br><br>
